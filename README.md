# YelpCamp
I did this project at the end of my Web Developer Bootcamp by Udemy. And this is Colt's famous yelpcamp.

YelpCamp is a website where users can create and discover different campgrounds uploaded by other users. In order to review or create a campground, you must have an account. This project was part of Colt Steele's web development course on udemy.

This project includes Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap.This website is fully CRUD based functionality. Bootstrap, Joi Schema Validations were used to handle Client-side validations and Passport.js was used to handle authentication.
